React webiste with modules. I made it to practice React library. It's one page simple website. Left section is made for practice logic of React. User can add new items, increase and decreace the quantity of specific item, sort items by quantity and delete them. Comments section of course lets user to add new comments. It also shows the time that passed from sending a message. Right section display picture that can be randomly changed by clicking "New" button.
